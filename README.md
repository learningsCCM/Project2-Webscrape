# Project2-Webscrape
 ## Python Analytics Class Project 2
 ### This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs webscraping tasks from Yahoo Finance tables.
 ### There are a couple of data pulls that bring tables into a dataframe, a funtion so that code could be reused/repeated for multiple pages or tables that are consitently named. There is also a function that allows for selection of specific quotes for comparison.
### What is not in thi file is data that is suitable for plotting.
